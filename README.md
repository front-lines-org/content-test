# content-test 

## WARN: none of the articles in this repo adhere to any quality standard, it's purely for testing purposes.
This is the repo that holds all content for the test environment site. Last update today. 

~~Including images. (not yet)~~, trying to test cache. Images will get their own repo for now, until we figure out what the best (free) CDN is. 

Just add a PR and mention me if you want to quickly test something for a feature or a fix.
